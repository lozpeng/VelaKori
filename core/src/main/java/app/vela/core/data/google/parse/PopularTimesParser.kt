/**
 * Extracts the rich place fields the keyless/list search trims out — popular times
 * (`[84]`), the editorial one-liner (`[32][1][1]`) and the owner's "From the owner"
 * blurb (`[154][0][0]`) — from a **WebView** `/search?tbm=map` response (see
 * [app.vela.web.WebPopularTimesFetcher] for why a WebView and why a *specific* query).
 *
 * A specific query (name + address) resolves to a single focused result whose place
 * node at `[0][1][0][14]` keeps all of these. [SearchParser] already snaps to that
 * node and reads them into a [app.vela.core.model.Place], so we just lift them off;
 * popular times has a second path that reads `[84]` straight off the focused node in
 * case SearchParser snapped to a different entry.
