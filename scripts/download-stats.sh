#
# There is no such thing as a unique downloader in GitHub's API - release assets carry a counter
# and nothing else. What there IS, and what disappears for good if nobody writes it down:
#
#   * a release's download counter, which the nightly prune deletes along with the release. The
#     in-app updater and Obtainium each pull an APK once per device per release, so the newest
#     stable's counter is the closest thing to a floor on active installs.
#   * the traffic API, which is a ROLLING 14 DAYS. Miss a fortnight and that fortnight is gone.
#   * which REGIONS people download, per asset, across the data catalogs. Aggregate, anonymous,
#     and the only signal there is about where Vela is actually used - it decides which bakes are
#     worth the runner time.
#
# Nothing here is telemetry: every number is a byproduct of hosting files, GitHub counts it whether
# we look or not, and none of it is attributable to a person.
#
# TWO TRAPS in reading the output, both of which make a number look smaller than the truth:
#   * REPLACING AN ASSET RESETS ITS COUNTER. Every re-bake does that, so a data release's figure is
#     "since this file was last rebuilt", never a total. The nightly places bake resets a seventh of
#     that catalog every night; the canary APK resets on every push, which is why canary is skipped
#     entirely rather than recorded as a suspiciously small number.
#   * The F-Droid channel is served from GitHub Pages, which publishes no counters at all. Those
#     installs are invisible here and always will be.
