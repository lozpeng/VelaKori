# Build cells-manifest.json from what the `cells-<region>` releases hold and upload it to the
# `grid-cells` release. The manifest is DERIVED from the published assets, never folded from this
# run's entries: a merge job pending in a concurrency group is canceled when a newer one joins, so
# a fold loses regions (see repair-places-manifest.sh). A region's row is its fragment
# (cells-<region>.json, uploaded after its zips) narrowed to the cells whose zip is on the
# release, sizes from the release listing. A release with zips and no fragment still gets rows,
# with the cell's box read off its key. Fragments in [fragments-dir] (this run's) win for their
# regions, since the release listing can lag an upload.
#
#   scripts/merge-cells-manifest.sh [fragments-dir]
#
# DRY_RUN=1 writes the manifest to $MANIFEST_OUT (default ./cells-manifest.json), uploads nothing.
