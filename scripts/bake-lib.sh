# pass over every node in the file, and buildings, landuse and the rest of the map are most of

# come along), ferry and shuttle-train routes and turn-restriction relations cuts a US-state
# extract to roughly a third of its bytes and a quarter of its nodes in a few seconds (route
# relations ride along for the bicycle profile's signed-route preference), which is
# what brings the big rows under a 16 GB runner's heap (measured on a state bake 2026-09-11, see
# CLAUDE.md). A bake that asks for the address or POI sections needs the whole file and skips it.

# OsmAnd's HIGHWAY HIERARCHY (HH) for the car profile, written into the region's own obf. Without
# it the app's router searches the whole road graph and a long route in a dense region fails at its
# 256 MB budget ("not enough memory", or the heap itself: Cologne to Munster, Aachen to Bielefeld);
# with it the same trips take under a second in about 80 MB (measured 2026-09-29 on the
# North Rhine-Westphalia obf, SPEC 4.5). Three MapCreator steps in a scratch folder: cluster the
# network (hh-routing-prepare), precompute the shortcuts (hh-routing-shortcuts, which also writes
# them as a small standalone obf named after the folder), then combine that section into the
# region file (BinaryInspector -c). A bicycle set too (about 10% of the file, best effort: a
# region it fails on keeps the car sets; VELA_OBF_HH_BIKE=0 skips it). Two car sets: the default car and car with avoid_motorway
# (the "Avoid highways" switch; without its own set the router falls back to the plain search and a
# long trip runs out of memory again). Avoid tolls and ferries need no set: the router filters the
# default one (Cologne to Munster avoiding tolls: 0.4 s). The second set adds about 2% to the file.
# The app turns HH on with setDefaultHHRoutingConfig() and falls
# back to the plain search on its own, so a file without HH still routes exactly as before.
# Returns non-zero and leaves <obf> untouched on any failure (an out-of-memory on a huge region).
